# Assets vs Resources (Repo Convention)

This repo currently contains a mix of legacy patterns. Going forward, we want a single consistent convention:

## Target Convention (Going Forward)

### `Assets/` (hand-authored source)

Put *source* content here:

- PNG/JPG source textures
- GLTF/GLB/OBJ source models
- Authoring JSON (tables, configs)
- Anything that is meant to be edited by humans

### `Resources/` (compiled/runtime-ready)

Put *compiled* or *runtime-packaged* content here:

- Baked databases (for example `Resources/Database/<GameName>.derpdoc`)
- Compiled engine content pipeline outputs
- Anything that is generated by build/export steps and should not be edited by hand

This aligns with the “compiled output” idea: `Resources/` should be safe to delete and regenerate.

## Current Reality (As Of Now)

Not all games follow the target convention yet.

- Many Raylib-based games load raw PNGs directly from `Resources/` (source) and sometimes `Assets/` (source).
- Derp engine content pipeline outputs are currently built into the runtime output directory under `data/db/...`
  (for example compiled fonts/textures/meshes). This is driven by `Engine/src/Engine/EngineComposition.cs`
  mounting `/data` to `AppContext.BaseDirectory/data`.

## Engine Content Pipeline Layout

The Derp engine content pipeline expects a “data directory” mounted at `/data` and typically uses:

```text
data/db/textures/*.texture
data/db/fonts/*.font
data/db/meshes/*.mesh
data/db/shaders/*.shader
```

For the target convention, the intent is:

- Authoring inputs live in `Assets/`
- Build/export produces engine-ready outputs into `Resources/` (and/or copies them into the runtime `data/` directory at build time)

Exact MSBuild wiring is part of Phase 5 work for Derp.Doc export and the broader asset pipeline.
